# Welcome to the canary branch! 

This is where i will push each and every update i make to TIMMY.

# Changelog VA3C (Alpha Version 3 Canary)

Updated the file structure. This is in regard to a planned future update where TIMMY becomes modular with support for community-made modules. Stay Tuned for more updates.

Exit Command is now gone. This new file structure somehow made TIMMY say everything twice with the exit function code. Till i am able to fix it, exit command is da gone.

# Known Issues 

For some reason, you can only talk to timmy on 2 loops, on the third command timmy will not even hear what you said. I am looking into this right now but it is quite irritating.

# Plans for the future 

1.Use the GPT API for more, *intelligent* reponses

2.Try and make some form of exe or easily accesssible opening mechanism, right now you
need to open it from the command line, and ONLY THE COMMAND LINE.

3. Make TIMMY Modular with support for community made modules.
