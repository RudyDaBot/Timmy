Timmy - Technically Intelligent Miniature Manly Youth 

install gtts, playsound and speech_recognition from pip before using!

# - This is an alpha release! 

This uses hardcoded if fucntions to respond to How are you, open task manager and exit.

# - Plans for the future 

1.Make it Manly and Young (it sounds like a middle aged woman)
2.Use the GPT API for more, *intelligent* reponses
3.clean up the code, looks like chaos in there
4.Try and make some form of exe or easily accesssible opening mechanism, right now you
need to open it from the command line, and ONLY THE COMMAND LINE.
