Timmy - Technically Intelligent Miniature Manly Youth 

install gtts, playsound and speech_recognition from pip before using!

# Welcome to the canary branch! 

This is where i will push each and every update i make to TIMMY.

# Changelog AV2C (Alpha Version 2 Canary)

Updated speech engine to pyttsx3. playsound and gtts are now gone.

I just realized breackets are not required in if functions, so i removed them so it looks cleaner.

Removed task manager command. Added "what is your name" and "who created you".

I will add more conversation commands before i make a push to main.

# Plans for the future 

1.Use the GPT API for more, *intelligent* reponses

2.Try and make some form of exe or easily accesssible opening mechanism, right now you
need to open it from the command line, and ONLY THE COMMAND LINE.
