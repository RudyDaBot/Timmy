# Welcome to the canary branch! 

This is where i will push each and every update i make to TIMMY.

# Plans for the future 

1.Make it Manly and Young (it sounds like a middle aged woman)

2.Use the GPT API for more, *intelligent* reponses

3.clean up the code, looks like chaos in there

4.Try and make some form of exe or easily accesssible opening mechanism, right now you
need to open it from the command line, and ONLY THE COMMAND LINE.
